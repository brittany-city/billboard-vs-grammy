# What is good music?: An in depth analysis of Grammy Award Winners and Billboard Hot 100 Songs over 60 Years

#### Project Status: Complete

## Motivation
Grammy nominees are selected by media companies and individual members registered with The Recording Academy (NARAS). The Billboard charts tabulate the relative weekly popularity of songs and albums in the U.S. and elsewhere. 

## Research questions: 
  1. Are the nation's musical preferences recognized for musical achievement by a select few (i.e. what is good music)? 
  2. Does song popularity guarantee Grammy glory?
